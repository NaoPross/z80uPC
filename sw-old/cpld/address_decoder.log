*** Source file is address_decoder.tt4 . Device is M4-32/32-15JC .

<Note>  F35109:  For this device, all input pairing is ignored since input
                 registers or latches do not exist. All signals must pass
                 through the central switch matrix before being latched or
                 registered.
<Note>  F40016:  0 pins have been reserved out of 34 .
<Note>  F40021:  34 pins are available after reservation, 21 are required
                 by the design.
<Note>  F35065:  For outputs, implicit output enables will be set to VCC.
